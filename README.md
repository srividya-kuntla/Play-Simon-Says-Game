# Play-Simon-Says-Game - Memory Challenge 

https://srividya-kuntla.github.io/Play-Simon-Game/

This project is an interactive Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges your memory and focus as you follow an increasingly complex sequence of blinking colors. Here's how it works:

## How to Play
Start the Game:
To begin and also to restart the game after end of the game, Press any key from keyboard.

## Game Mechanism:

A random color box will blink for 0.25 seconds, turning white briefly before reverting to its original color.
Identify the color that blinked and click on it to proceed.
If your choice is correct, an additional color will be added to the sequence.
Memorize and replicate the entire sequence of blinking colors in the correct order.

## Score and High Score:

Each time you correctly complete a sequence, your level increases, and the sequence gets longer.
If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score (based on the completed level) will be displayed.
If your score surpasses the previous record, it will update as the high score.

## Features

Simple and intuitive user interface with colorful boxes.
Engaging gameplay to test and improve memory skills.
Dynamic scoring system with a visible high score tracker.
